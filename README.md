#Snake Game 

This repository contains a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts including user input handling, collision detection, and game state management.

Files Included:
main.py: The entry point of the game, initializing the game window, managing the game loop, and handling the overall game state.
snake.py: Implements the Snake class for movement, growth, and collision detection.
food.py: Defines the Food class for random food placement and collision with the snake.
scoreboard.py: Implements the Scoreboard class for tracking and displaying the player's score.

Features:
Dynamic Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys.
Food Collection: The snake grows longer with each food item consumed.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
Score Tracking: Displays the current score on the screen.
